    <p class="context1stline">The colours for this website were inspired by images and hard copy texts of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The background colours were inspired by searching Google for images of Wonderland and using Color Rotate to choose a color scheme from the images. The blue background on the home page was inspired by a hard copy of the book that uses a similar blue. After the background colours were chosen, they were lightened to improve contrast and readability.</p>

		<h3>Font Stack </h3>
		<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is full of what Mr. Carroll would call &quot;nonsense.&quot; While I was tempted to take the font selection and presentation fully in a nonsensical direction with text in all sorts of fonts and directions, I reserved this for key quotes and phrases in order to preserve readability. For the paragraphs, I chose serif fonts, which underpinned the theme of nonsense: Roboto Slab and Fredericka the Great. These fonts are thicker than most serif fonts and seemed to grab attention while also indicating, don't take it too seriously. They are playful fonts that fit the atmosphere of Down the Rabbit Hole. </p>

		<p> For sidebar quotes, I chose quirky fonts to fit with the theme of the story. Wonderland is a place where things don't always make sense but there is much wisdom floating about. Riddles abound in Wonderland and its inhabitants are a little mad. I chose a wiry font called Amatic SC because its delicate and jagged lines convey this feeling.</p>

		<h3>Why Down the Rabbit Hole? </h3>
		<p> I chose Down the Rabbit Hole because I refer to my career change into web design and tech as a neverending journey full of curiosities. Often times I feel I've fallen down a rabbit hole when I find myself learning how to do something in HTML, CSS or Javascript, which then leads me to something else I want to learn. This excerpt best reflects the journey I'm on.</p>
