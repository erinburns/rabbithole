    <p> Lewis Carroll is the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. He was born on 27 January 1832, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England. He is best known for his literary works, <span class="booktitle">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass,</span> and the poems "The Hunting of the Snark" and "Jabberwocky". In addition to writing, Dodgson was an English logician, mathematician, photographer, and Church of England Deacon. The following are some famous quotes from <span class="booktitle">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</span>: </p>

    <blockquote>“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.
    <p>“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”</p> </blockquote>

    <blockquote> <span class="who">&quot;Who are YOU?&quot;</span> said the Caterpillar.
			This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I–I hardly know, sir, just at present– at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.&quot;  </blockquote>

    <blockquote> <span class="curious"> &quot;Curiouser and curiouser!&quot; </span></blockquote>
