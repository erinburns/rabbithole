    <p> Many production companies have brought their interpretation of Alice's world to real life through immersive theatre experiences.</p>

    <p> In London, Les Enfant Terribles, in collaboration with ebp, produce <a href="https://www.alice-underground.com/" class="inlinelink">Alice’s Adventures Underground</a>, which takes place in the Vaults beneath Waterloo station. </p>

		<p>Also in London is <a href="http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/whats-on/2017/the-mad-hatters-tea-party/" class="inlinelink">Mad Hatter's Tea Party</a>, a hip-hop dance performance by <a href="http://www.zoonation.co.uk/" class="inlinelink">ZooNation</a>, based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. </p>

    <p>In New York City, Third Rail Projects produces <a href="http://www.thenshefell.com/" class="inlinelink">Then She Fell</a>, a &quot;fully immersive, multi-sensory experience in which only 15 audience members per performance explore a dreamscape where every alcove, corner, and corridor has been transformed into a lushly designed world. Inspired by the life and writings of Lewis Carroll, it offers an Alice-like experience for audience members as they explore the rooms, often by themselves, in order to discover hidden scenes&semi; encounter performers one-on-one&semi; unearth clues that illuminate a shrouded history&semi; use skeleton keys to gain access to guarded secrets&semi; and imbibe elixirs custom designed by one of NYC’s foremost mixologists.&quot; </p>
